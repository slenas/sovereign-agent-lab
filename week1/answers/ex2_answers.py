# ── Task A ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The only issue is that the image could be better especially around typos and fonts despite us asking the model to pay special attention to all these aspects through the corresponding prompt."   # optional — anything unexpected

# ── Task B ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Has generate_event_flyer been implemented (not just the stub)?
TASK_B_IMPLEMENTED = True   # True or False

# The image URL returned (or the error message if still a stub).

None of the known venues meet the requirements for 300 people with vegan options. The Albanach, The Haymarket Vaults, and The Bow Bar do not have sufficient capacity, and The Guilford Arms does not offer vegan options.

# Would this behaviour be acceptable in a real booking assistant? Min 30 words.
SCENARIO_3_ACCEPTABLE = """
Yes, that would be a perfectably acceptable answer as the model didn't hallucinate by imagining any times that the last train leaves and pointed the user to the right direction without delving into many details.

# Compare the LangGraph graph to exercise3_rasa/data/rules.yml. Min 30 words.
TASK_D_COMPARISON = """
the Mermaid graph is a general reasoning loop, while flows.yml is an explicit task workflow with deterministic execution after flow selection. Unlike Mermaid, Rasa explicitly handles out-of-scope requests and defines ordered slot collection (guest_count, vegan_count, deposit_amount_gbp) with guided prompts and LLM extraction, making behavior more predictable and easier to audit, though less flexible.

MOST_SURPRISING = """
In task C - scenario 1 the agent partly hallucinated. It successfully completed the task asked to do but then it hallucinated both regarding the event theme, which it thought it was about a vegan meetup and the price per head, which it suggested 25.5 per head.
